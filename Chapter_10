Chapter 10: Batch Processing â€” Summary
Batch processing is about processing large volumes of data efficiently, often used for analytics, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), and machine learning. This chapter explains the architecture and tools behind batch processing and how it compares with streaming systems.

ðŸ§  Key Concepts:
1. Batch Processing vs. Stream Processing
Batch Processing: Fixed input size, processed in bulk.


Stream Processing: Real-time, continuous processing of incoming data.


2. Dataflow Graphs
Jobs in batch processing are often modeled as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of computation steps.


Nodes represent operations (e.g., map, reduce), and edges represent data flow.


3. MapReduce Paradigm
Map: Converts input data into key-value pairs.


Shuffle: Groups data by key and sends to reducers.


Reduce: Aggregates values per key.


Designed for horizontal scalability and fault tolerance.


4. Workflow Orchestration
Tools like Apache Oozie, Airflow, or Luigi manage job dependencies and scheduling.


Handles job retries, failures, and monitoring.


5. Fault Tolerance
Uses retries, checkpointing, and re-execution of failed tasks.


Intermediate results are usually written to disk to support retries.


6. Distributed Filesystems
Systems like HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) store large datasets across many nodes.


Optimized for high-throughput rather than low-latency access.


7. Sorting & Joins
Sorting data is often a precondition for operations like reduce or join.


Techniques such as repartitioning and merge joins are used for efficient processing.


8. Output Consistency
Results of a batch job should be idempotent to allow safe retries.


Common practice: write results to a new directory or versioned dataset.


9. Designing Batch Pipelines
Split into independent steps (modularization).


Each stepâ€™s output is stored, making the system more debuggable and fault-tolerant.


10. Limitations
High latency: not suitable for low-latency requirements.


Complexity increases with DAG orchestration and dependencies.

ðŸŽ¯ Product-Based Interview Q&A
Q1: What is batch processing and how is it different from stream processing?
Answer:
 Batch processing handles large volumes of data in chunks (batches), with fixed input size and high throughput. Stream processing deals with data continuously as it arrives, suitable for low-latency and real-time use cases.

Q2: Explain the MapReduce model. How does it ensure fault tolerance?
Answer:
 MapReduce divides processing into map and reduce phases, operating on key-value pairs. It ensures fault tolerance by writing intermediate results to disk, allowing failed tasks to be re-executed from the last successful point.

Q3: What are common challenges in building a batch processing system?
Answer:
Fault tolerance: Handling node failures and retries.


Scalability: Efficiently processing large datasets.


Data skew: Uneven distribution of data across nodes.


Debugging: Understanding where and why a failure occurred in a DAG.



Q4: How is fault tolerance handled in batch processing frameworks like Hadoop?
Answer:
 Frameworks like Hadoop use:
Intermediate data persistence


Task retries


Data replication in distributed file systems


Job restart at failed stages using checkpointed states



Q5: Why is idempotency important in batch processing jobs?
Answer:
 Idempotency ensures that a job or task can be retried without altering the final result. This is crucial in distributed systems where retries due to partial failures are common.

Q6: How do distributed file systems like HDFS help in batch processing?
Answer:
 They provide scalable, fault-tolerant storage for large datasets and allow concurrent access by multiple worker nodes. They are optimized for high-throughput read/write patterns typical of batch jobs.

Q7: What are shuffle and partitioning in MapReduce?
Answer:
 Shuffle: The stage where data is grouped by key and sent to appropriate reducers.
 Partitioning: Determines which reducer processes a given key, enabling parallelism and load balancing.

ðŸ§© Practical Tip
Design your batch pipelines to be modular, idempotent, and observable. This not only improves fault tolerance but also makes debugging and maintenance easier in production systems.

Would you like visual diagrams, comparison charts with stream processing, or hands-on questions as well (e.g., design a batch job for X use case)?
